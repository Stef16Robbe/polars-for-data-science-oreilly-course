Add basic attributes and functions to Getting Started, such as .describe(), .columns, .shape, .len. Also printing a dataframe. Also creating pl.DataFrame from scratch (dictionary). And .null_count()!!

to interop/io module, i should add a part about loading * file paterns.

in conclusion slide, i should go through the docs and show "we've covered mostly an intro of the API, here. if you want to compute something on a column, it's easy to simply go check out the column expression docs" (video of scrolling through the namespaces).

Create an install script for Getting Started that includes jupyter, polars (with the polars-lts-cpu library if necessary), lightgbm (and libomp if necessary),

as of 1.0.0, i think `drop` accepts column expressions, not just strings.
the plotting engine has changed from hvplot!
