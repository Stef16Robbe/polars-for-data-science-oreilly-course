Add basic attributes and functions to Getting Started, such as .describe(), .columns, .shape, .len. Also printing a dataframe. Also creating pl.DataFrame from scratch (dictionary). And .null_count()!!

to interop/io module, i should add a part about loading * file paterns.

in conclusion slide, i should go through the docs and show "we've covered mostly an intro of the API, here. if you want to compute something on a column, it's easy to simply go check out the column expression docs" (video of scrolling through the namespaces).

Create an install script for Getting Started that includes jupyter, polars (with the polars-lts-cpu library if necessary), lightgbm (and libomp if necessary),

as of 1.0.0, i think `drop` accepts column expressions, not just strings.
the plotting engine has changed from hvplot!





2024-09-15 RERECORDING!!

Segment 1.2: You mentioned citations that need to be added. Please update the slides with citations and I can add them in. No need to re-record the video for that one.

Segment 2.1: Please re-record this section to show the latest version of Polars. You could also just record up until 1:36 and I can splice it with rest of the file once you finish discussing Importing Polars. 

Segment 3.2: Video is frozen in the source file "03_data_manipulation_i_basics.mov" from 5:20-5:37 will need to re-record that section of video to fix. 

Segment 6.1: Will need to re-record to fix the older version that is mentioned. 

Segment 8.5: Re-record short section to fix the mention of the "experimental stage"

as of 1.0.0, i think `drop` accepts column expressions, not just strings.

the plotting engine has changed from hvplot!
